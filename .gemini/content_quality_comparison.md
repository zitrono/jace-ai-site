## Folder Analysis Excerpt (Comprehensive)

The analysis included:
- Full exploration of directory structure
- Reading and analyzing configuration files (astro.config.mjs, package.json)
- Examining individual components and their relationships
- Discovering the design token system implementation
- Understanding the build pipeline and optimizations
- Identifying specific patterns like the Manager pattern in main.ts
- Finding accessibility features and performance optimizations

Example insight:
"The project uses a design token system, defined in `src/config/design-system.ts`. This centralizes all design decisions (colors, spacing, typography) and ensures consistency across the UI. The `generate-tokens.ts` script can be used to generate CSS variables and Tailwind theme extensions from these tokens."

## Merged File Analysis Excerpt (Summary)

The analysis provided:
- High-level architectural overview
- Identification of main patterns
- Basic understanding of state management
- General TypeScript usage patterns

Example insight:
"The project is a modern static website built with the **Astro framework**. The architecture is front-end focused and follows a well-structured, component-based model."

## Key Difference

The folder analysis discovered implementation details by exploring the codebase, while the merged file analysis only reported on what was directly visible in the concatenated code.
