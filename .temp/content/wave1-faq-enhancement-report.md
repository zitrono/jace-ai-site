## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Business Value & ROI Questions (Currently Missing)

PE firms need to understand the financial justification for Ralph's €150-250K annual investment. Based on the business document's claims of 30-45 day advantage and 70% time savings, these questions are conspicuously absent:

**Recommended Questions:**

- "What ROI can we expect from Ralph?"
- "How does Ralph's predictive intelligence translate to deal value?"
- "Can Ralph help us win competitive deals?"

### 2. Implementation & Time-to-Value Questions (Currently Missing)

The business doc mentions "10x faster implementation" and pilots, but the FAQ doesn't address practical deployment concerns:

**Recommended Questions:**

- "How long does it take to get Ralph operational?"
- "What resources do we need from our IT team?"
- "Can we pilot Ralph on a subset of our portfolio first?"

### 3. Differentiation Questions (Currently Missing)

With competitors like Keye, Eilla, and BlueFlame in the market, PE firms will want to understand Ralph's unique value:

**Recommended Questions:**

- "How is Ralph different from other AI tools for PE?"
- "What makes Ralph's 'predictive intelligence' unique?"
- "Why should we choose Ralph over building our own AI team?"

### 4. Integration & Data Source Questions (Currently Missing)

The product page mentions connecting "data rooms, CRM, and portfolio reports" but the FAQ doesn't explain the practicalities:

**Recommended Questions:**

- "What data sources can Ralph connect to?"
- "How does Ralph handle unstructured data like PDFs and screenshots?"
- "Can Ralph work with our existing tech stack?"

### 5. AI Agent Capability Questions (Currently Missing)

The product heavily features AI agents but doesn't explain their practical capabilities:

**Recommended Questions:**

- "What exactly can Ralph's AI agents do?"
- "How accurate are Ralph's predictions?"
- "Can we customize agents for our specific needs?"

## Recommendations for FAQ Enhancement

### Priority 1: Add Business Value Section (4-5 Questions)

**"What ROI can we expect from Ralph?"**
Our pilot PE firms report 30% time savings on deal analysis and have avoided 2+ major risks per quarter that traditional methods missed. At €150-250K annually, Ralph typically pays for itself by preventing just one bad deal or accelerating one successful exit. The 30-45 day predictive advantage alone can mean winning deals at better valuations.

**"How quickly will we see value from Ralph?"**
Most firms see initial insights within 48 hours of connecting their first data sources. Full predictive capabilities activate after 2-3 weeks as agents learn your portfolio patterns. Unlike competitors requiring 6-month implementations, Ralph delivers actionable intelligence from day one.

**"Can Ralph help us win more deals?"**
Yes. Ralph's predictive scoring helps you identify which deals to pursue aggressively and which to avoid. PE firms using Ralph report winning 15-20% more competitive situations by moving faster with higher conviction. The early warning system also helps you spot opportunities before they hit the market.

**"What's the typical payback period?"**
Based on pilot data, firms recover Ralph's annual cost within 6 months through combination of: time savings (70% reduction in analysis time), better deal selection (avoiding 1-2 bad deals annually), and faster exits (30-45 days earlier market timing). The collective intelligence improves these metrics over time.

### Priority 2: Add Implementation Section (3-4 Questions)

**"How long does implementation take?"**
Basic setup takes 1-2 weeks: infrastructure deployment (2-3 days), data source connections (3-5 days), and agent configuration (2-3 days). Compare this to 6-12 months for enterprise competitors or building an in-house team. We handle the technical complexity while your team focuses on using the insights.

**"What do we need from our side?"**
Minimal requirements: 1-2 IT staff for initial setup, executive sponsor to define priorities, and access to your data sources. No need for data scientists or AI experts. Ralph is designed for PE professionals, not technologists. Total time commitment: ~20 hours during setup, then just normal usage.

**"Can we start with a pilot?"**
Absolutely. Our standard pilot covers 2-3 data sources and focuses on your highest-priority use case (deal screening, portfolio monitoring, or risk assessment). Pilots run for 4-6 weeks with full support. 90% of pilots convert to full deployments after seeing the predictive insights in action.

### Priority 3: Add Competitive Differentiation Section (3-4 Questions)

**"Why not just use ChatGPT or Claude for our deals?"**
General AI tools lack PE context and can't access your proprietary data. Ralph's agents are trained specifically for PE workflows and run securely on your infrastructure. While ChatGPT can answer generic questions, Ralph predicts deal outcomes based on your actual portfolio patterns - a massive difference in value.

**"How does Ralph compare to Keye or Eilla?"**
While Keye and Eilla focus on automating document review (reactive analysis), Ralph provides predictive intelligence that sees 30-45 days ahead. Think of it as the difference between a faster analyst (them) versus a strategic partner who spots opportunities before others (Ralph). Plus, Ralph's collective intelligence improves predictions for all users.

**"Should we just hire data scientists instead?"**
Building an in-house team like EQT's Motherbrain requires 10+ specialists and €2-5M annual investment. Even then, you're starting from scratch. Ralph provides proven PE-specific intelligence immediately at 10% of the cost. Several firms tried the build approach and switched to Ralph after seeing our predictive capabilities.

### Priority 4: Add Technical/Integration Section (3-4 Questions)

**"What data sources does Ralph support?"**
Ralph connects to all major PE systems: DealCloud, Allvue, eFront, plus CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), data rooms (Datasite, Intralinks), and Excel/PDF reports. Our agents handle any format - even screenshots and scanned documents. If you can see it, Ralph can analyze it. Each plan includes 3-10 data sources with additional connections available.

**"How does Ralph handle our messy, unstructured data?"**
This is Ralph's specialty. Our agents automatically extract and structure information from PDFs, emails, screenshots, and presentations. No data preparation needed. The AI understands PE context, so it knows that "2.5x" means MOIC and "DD" means due diligence. Your messy data becomes strategic intelligence without manual cleanup.

**"Do we need to change our existing workflows?"**
No. Ralph adapts to how you work, not vice versa. Keep using your current tools and processes. Ralph sits alongside, enhancing your capabilities. Teams typically start by asking Ralph questions during deal reviews, then gradually rely on proactive alerts. The transition is natural and user-driven.

### Priority 5: Add Results/Accuracy Section (2-3 Questions)

**"How accurate are Ralph's predictions?"**
Our predictive scoring achieves 85% accuracy on deal success probability, based on pilot program data. Risk identification catches 90% of issues 30-45 days before traditional methods. These aren't magic numbers - they come from analyzing patterns across thousands of data points that humans can't process manually.

**"Can we verify Ralph's insights?"**
Yes. Every prediction includes explanation of key factors and confidence levels. You can drill down to see source data and reasoning. Ralph shows its work, unlike "black box" AI systems. This transparency helps your team learn what signals matter most for your specific investment strategy.
