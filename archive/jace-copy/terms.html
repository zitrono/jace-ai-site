Acceptance of Terms</h1><p>Welcome to <strong>Jace.ai</strong>, an AI-powered email assistant service provided by <strong>Zeta AI, Inc.</strong> (&quot;<strong>Zeta AI</strong>,&quot; &quot;<strong>we</strong>,&quot; or &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot;). These Terms of Use (&quot;<strong>Terms</strong>&quot;) govern your access to and use of the Service, including any content, functionality, and services offered through our website and applications. By creating an account or otherwise using the Service,<!-- --> <strong>you agree to be bound by these Terms</strong>. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Service.</p><p>You represent that you are at least 16 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) and legally capable of entering into a binding agreement. The Service is not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 16.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">2. Description of the Service</h1><p><strong>Jace.ai</strong> is an AI-driven email assistant that integrates with your email account to help draft emails, summarize threads, manage your inbox, and perform related tasks on your behalf. Key aspects of the Service include:</p><ul><li><strong>Email Integration:</strong> Our Service currently supports integration with <strong>Google&#x27;s Gmail</strong> via the Gmail API. By connecting Jace.ai to your Gmail account, you authorize us to access and process your Gmail data as described in our Privacy Policy and in these Terms.<!-- --> <em>At this time, Gmail is the only supported email provider.</em> <!-- -->Support for additional email providers (such as Outlook or others) may be added in the future, and any such integrations will be subject to these Terms and possibly additional terms or consents. We will inform users when new integrations become available.</li><li><strong>AI-Powered Assistance:</strong> The Service uses advanced AI (including third-party AI services) to analyze email content and generate outputs. For example, Jace.ai can draft responses in your writing style, highlight action items from an email thread, or triage your inbox. You can review, edit, and send these AI-generated suggestions as you see fit. The AI strives to understand context and produce helpful results, but it operates based on patterns and information available to it, and it may occasionally produce incorrect or inappropriate suggestions (see<!-- --> <strong>AI Content and Disclaimers</strong> below).</li><li><strong>Browser Extension (if applicable):</strong> We may offer an optional browser extension to integrate Jace.ai into your email web interface (such as Gmail&#x27;s web client). Any such extension will primarily serve as a user interface convenience (for example, adding a button to trigger Jace.ai functions) and will be governed by these Terms as well. The extension will not collect additional data beyond what the Service collects; its privacy practices are addressed in our Privacy Policy and the extension&#x27;s specific policy if provided.</li></ul><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">3. Account Registration and Security</h1><p>To use Jace.ai, you will need to create an account and connect it to your email service (e.g., authenticate via Google OAuth for Gmail access). When registering and using the Service, you agree to the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Provide Accurate Information:</strong> You must provide true, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted during the registration process. This includes maintaining a valid email address and any other required details.</li><li><strong>Account Credentials:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials. Do not share your password or allow others to access your account. If you use a third-party login (such as Google OAuth), ensure your third-party account remains secure as well.</li><li><strong>Responsibility for Account Use:</strong> You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you authorized them. If you notice any unauthorized use of your account or suspect that your account credentials have been compromised, you must notify us<!-- --> <strong>immediately</strong> at team@zetalabs.ai. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your credentials if you fail to notify us promptly.</li><li><strong>One Account; Personal Use:</strong> Unless otherwise authorized by us, you agree to create and use only one account for your personal (or internal business) use. You will not create multiple accounts or impersonate others. If you are an entity or business allowing your employees to use Jace.ai, each individual user must have their own account and agree to these Terms.</li></ul><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">4. User Permissions and Email Access</h1><p>By connecting Jace.ai to your email account, you grant Zeta AI the rights and permissions necessary to access and process your emails on your behalf:</p><ul><li><strong>OAuth Consent:</strong> You understand that the Service uses Google&#x27;s OAuth authentication to request access to your Gmail data. During signup or connection, you will be presented with Google&#x27;s consent screen detailing the permissions we request (such as the ability to read, compose, send, and manage your emails). By granting consent, you authorize us to use those permissions in order to provide the Service. You may revoke the Service&#x27;s access to your Google account at any time via your Google security settings; however, if access is revoked, core features of Jace.ai will no longer function.</li><li><strong>Scope of Email Access:</strong> With your permission, Jace.ai will analyze emails to provide AI assistance. Jace.ai may also draft or send emails<!-- --> <strong>on your instruction</strong>. For example, if you use Jace.ai to compose a reply and you accept that draft, we can, at your direction, send the email through your Gmail account. Jace.ai may also apply labels or perform email management tasks that you explicitly trigger.</li><li><strong>Use of Data:</strong> Any data obtained from your email account will be used strictly in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Google&#x27;s user data policies. We do not use your email content for any purpose other than to provide you with the Service functionality. We do not provide your email content to any third party except as necessary to power the AI and features (as detailed in the Privacy Policy, e.g., sending content to an AI API to generate a reply for you). We do not use your emails to advertise or market to you outside of the Service&#x27;s own features.</li><li><strong>Account Connectivity:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining an active email account and a working internet connection for the Service to function properly. We are not responsible for issues arising from changes in third-party services (for instance, if Google makes changes that affect our integration, we will do our best to adapt, but some downtime or changes in functionality might occur).</li></ul><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">5. Acceptable Use Policy</h1><p>We are committed to ensuring the Service is used safely and lawfully. By using Jace.ai, you agree to the following acceptable use conditions and <strong>you will NOT</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Illegal Activities:</strong> Use the Service for any unlawful, illegal, or fraudulent activities. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using Jace.ai. This includes not using the Service to harass, defraud, stalk, threaten, or otherwise violate the legal rights of others.</li><li><strong>Infringement of Rights:</strong> Use the Service to violate intellectual property rights or privacy rights of others. For example, you should not use the AI to generate content that infringes someone&#x27;s copyright or to disseminate someone else&#x27;s confidential information without permission.</li><li><strong>Unauthorized Access and Misuse:</strong> Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any system, account, or data related to the Service. This means you will not try to access another user&#x27;s account, evade our authentication or security measures, or probe or test the vulnerability of our infrastructure. Additionally, you agree not to misuse Jace.ai&#x27;s email-processing features – for instance, you will not use automation to send spam or mass emails in violation of email laws (such as CAN-SPAM or GDPR), and you will not use the Service to launch phishing campaigns, spread malware, or otherwise compromise email security.</li><li><strong>Interference with the Service:</strong> Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service. This includes not uploading or transmitting any worms, viruses, or harmful code, and not performing actions that impose an unreasonable load on our infrastructure (such as automated scraping or excessive API requests outside the intended use).</li><li><strong>Circumvention:</strong> Attempt to bypass or circumvent any usage limits, security features, or content filtering that we may implement. The Service may impose certain limits (for example, on the number of AI-generated drafts per day or the volume of email data processed) to ensure stable service for all users. You agree not to use any hacks, unauthorized bots, or unofficial modifications of our software to exceed these limits or gain unauthorized functionality.</li><li><strong>Malicious or Harmful Content:</strong> Use the Service to generate or disseminate content that is defamatory, obscene, offensive, or that promotes hate, violence, or illegal activities. While we understand the AI might occasionally produce unpredictable outputs, you agree not to deliberately use it to create malicious content (e.g., generating hate speech, abusive messages, or disinformation) or, if such content is generated, not to distribute it. You remain responsible for reviewing AI outputs (see<!-- --> <strong>AI Content</strong> below) before using them.</li><li><strong>Misrepresentations:</strong> Falsely imply that content generated by the AI was created by you or a human when doing so could mislead the recipient in a harmful way. (For example, using the AI to impersonate someone else in an email is prohibited.) You should use the Service ethically and not in a manner that deceives others about the nature of the content.</li></ul><p>Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Service (see<!-- --> <strong>Termination</strong> below), and could also expose you to legal liabilities. We reserve the right to investigate any violation of this section and to cooperate with law enforcement as appropriate.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">6. Data Handling and Privacy</h1><p>Your privacy is very important to us. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that Zeta AI will collect, use, and store your data as outlined in our<!-- --> <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> (which is incorporated herein by reference). Key points include:</p><ul><li><strong>Email Storage:</strong> When you connect your email to Jace.ai, we will securely store copies of your emails and related data on our servers to enable fast AI processing and searching. This is necessary for providing you features like quick email drafting and context-aware suggestions. We take measures to secure this stored data (as detailed in our Privacy Policy).</li><li><strong>Data Processing by AI:</strong> You understand that content from your emails will be processed by automated AI systems, which may include secure transmission to third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI or others) for analysis and generation of results. Such processing is done in accordance with data protection laws and our Privacy Policy. We ensure that any third-party processors are under strict obligations to protect your data.</li><li><strong>Anonymized Usage Data:</strong> We may use anonymized and aggregated data derived from your usage for improving our services and algorithms. For example, we might track how often users use a &quot;summarize email&quot; feature in general, or analyze common correction patterns to improve AI suggestions. This data will not identify you personally.</li><li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> We comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our European users. If you are a user in a jurisdiction providing specific privacy rights (such as the GDPR or CCPA), you can exercise those rights as described in the Privacy Policy.</li><li><strong>Data Removal:</strong> You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us at team@zetalabs.ai. Upon such a request, or if you deactivate your account, we will delete your stored emails and personal data from the Service within the timeframes described in our Privacy Policy. (Generally, we aim to remove data promptly, and no later than the maximum period allowed by law.) Keep in mind that deletion is irreversible – if you return to the Service after a full deletion, you may need to re-import emails and setup your preferences anew.</li><li><strong>Privacy Policy Governance:</strong> In the event of any inconsistency between this section and our Privacy Policy, the Privacy Policy will govern how we handle your personal data. We encourage you to read it carefully to understand our practices in detail. By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy.</li></ul><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">7. Intellectual Property Rights</h1><p>All content, software, algorithms, and materials comprising the Service are the property of Zeta AI or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. This includes (but is not limited to) the platform&#x27;s code, the website design, the Jace.ai name and logos, and any proprietary AI models or prompts developed by us.</p><ul><li><strong>License to You:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Service for your personal or internal business use. You may not resell or commercialize access to our Service or any content or outputs from our Service (except for the normal use of AI-generated email content in your personal/business communications).</li><li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> You will not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Service&#x27;s code or content (except your own data). You will not reverse engineer or decompile any technology associated with the Service, nor attempt to extract source code or algorithms from the Service, except to the extent that such actions are explicitly permitted by law notwithstanding this limitation.</li><li><strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain ownership of the content of your emails and any other data you provide to us. By using the Service and providing your content (such as email text or any inputs you give to the AI), you grant Zeta AI a<!-- --> <strong>limited license</strong> to use that content as necessary to provide the Service. This means, for example, we have your permission to process an email you wrote to generate a reply, or to store your emails in our database to enable search functionality for you. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and sublicensable<!-- --> <strong>only</strong> to our subprocessors (like our cloud or AI providers) for the sole purpose of operating and improving the Service for you. We do not claim ownership over your personal content, and aside from this limited license, you reserve all rights in your content.</li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you choose to provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas about the Service (&quot;Feedback&quot;), you agree that we may use the Feedback freely and without restriction, without any obligation to compensate you. Feedback can help us improve our product, but we are not obliged to implement any suggestion you provide.</li></ul><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">8. AI Content and Disclaimers</h1><p>The Service involves the use of AI to generate content (such as email drafts, summaries, or recommendations). While our goal is to assist you and improve your productivity, it is important to understand the following:</p><ul><li><strong>AI-Generated Content May Be Imperfect:</strong> AI is not infallible. The content generated by Jace.ai (or its underlying AI models) might occasionally be incorrect, misleading, incomplete, or inappropriate. For example, the AI might misunderstand a context and draft a response that doesn&#x27;t make sense, or it might make up information (this is sometimes known as an &quot;AI hallucination&quot;).<!-- --> <strong>You are responsible for reviewing and verifying the AI-generated content</strong> <!-- -->before you use it (such as before sending an email drafted by the AI). Do not blindly trust the AI&#x27;s outputs, especially for critical or sensitive communications.</li><li><strong>No Professional or Legal Advice:</strong> Any suggestions or content generated by the Service should not be considered professional advice (legal, financial, medical, or otherwise). Always use your judgment. For instance, if the AI drafts language that seems to make a legal commitment on your behalf, ensure it is what you intend and consider consulting a professional if needed. Zeta AI is not liable for any actions you take based on AI outputs.</li><li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> By using the AI features, you acknowledge that<!-- --> <strong>you are the author of any final email or content sent using our Service</strong>. The AI may assist in writing, but you are the one sending the communication. You are responsible for the content of your emails, including anything inserted or recommended by the AI. If the AI suggests something you don&#x27;t agree with or that could be harmful, you should edit or discard it.</li><li><strong>Use at Your Own Risk:</strong> You understand that using AI to automate emails comes with risks, including the possibility that the AI&#x27;s suggestion might not convey what you truly mean or could be incorrect. We provide the AI functionality &quot;as-is&quot; (see <strong>Disclaimers</strong> below) and you use it at your discretion and risk.</li></ul><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">9. Payment and Subscription (if applicable)</h1><p>If you purchase a subscription or pay for any portion of the Service, you agree to the pricing, payment, and billing policies applicable to your purchase, as posted on our website or app. All fees are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified. You authorize Zeta AI (or our payment processor) to charge your chosen payment method for the applicable fees and taxes.</p><ul><li><strong>Trials and Promotions:</strong> If we offer free trials or promotional subscriptions, those are subject to these Terms as well. We reserve the right to modify or terminate any trial or promotion at our discretion. After a trial ends, you may be charged unless you cancel, if that was indicated in the promotion terms.</li><li><strong>Auto-Renewals:</strong> Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or annual, depending on your plan) unless you cancel beforehand. You can cancel through the account billing settings. If you cancel, you will retain access until the end of the paid period; no refunds will be provided for the remaining days of a subscription period except where required by law.</li><li><strong>Changes in Fees:</strong> We may change our fees for the Service, but we will give you advance notice of any price changes. Price changes will not affect the current subscription period and will only apply upon renewal. If you do not agree to a price change, you must cancel your subscription before the new rate takes effect.</li><li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Fees are generally non-refundable except at our discretion or where required by law. If you believe there has been an error in billing or you deserve a refund due to extenuating circumstances, please contact us and we will review your request.</li><li><strong>Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for any taxes or duties assessed on the Service (such as sales tax, VAT, or similar). If we are required to collect taxes, those will be added to your charges.</li></ul><p><em>(If the Service is currently free to users, this section may not apply. In that case, using the Service is free of charge, but Zeta AI reserves the right to introduce paid features or subscriptions in the future with appropriate notice.)</em></p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">10. Termination of Service</h1><p><strong>By You:</strong> You may stop using the Service at any time. You can disconnect Jace.ai from your email and/or delete your account if you wish to terminate your use. If you wish to have your data deleted, please follow the instructions in the Privacy Policy or Section 6 above (Data Removal).</p><p><strong>By Us:</strong> Zeta AI reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service (or any part thereof) at any time, with or without notice, if we believe that: (a) you have violated these Terms (or any policies incorporated by reference), (b) you pose a security, legal, or business risk to the Service or other users, or (c) we decide to discontinue the Service entirely. We will try to give advance notice and an opportunity to cure minor violations when feasible, but we are not obligated to do so.</p><p><strong>Effects of Termination:</strong> Upon termination for any reason, your right to access or use the Service will immediately cease. We may deactivate or delete your account and all associated data. However, sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as indemnification, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and governing law) <strong>will survive</strong>. If your account is terminated due to a breach of these Terms, you are not entitled to any refund of fees (if any were paid).</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">11. Disclaimers of Warranties</h1><p><strong>Use at Your Own Risk:</strong> The Service (including all content, functions, and AI features) is provided on an &quot;<strong>as is</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>as available</strong>&quot; basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Zeta AI disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties that may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade. We do<!-- --> <strong>not</strong> guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</p><p><strong>AI Outputs:</strong> Zeta AI makes no warranty or guarantee regarding the accuracy, quality, or reliability of any AI-generated content. We do not warrant that using the AI will improve your communications or achieve any specific results desired by you. You assume all risk for any actions taken based on the information or content provided by the Service.</p><p><strong>No Responsibility for Third-Party Services:</strong> We are not responsible for the availability or proper functioning of any third-party services that the Service relies on, such as Google&#x27;s Gmail service or any AI API providers. We do not guarantee continued compatibility with any third-party service. (For example, if Google changes its API or permissions, our integration may be affected. We will do our best to adapt, but some features could become temporarily or permanently unavailable outside our control.)</p><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such cases, our warranties will be limited to the minimum extent permitted by applicable law.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">12. Limitation of Liability</h1><p>To the maximum extent permitted by law,<!-- --> <strong>Zeta AI, Inc. and its officers, directors, employees, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</strong> <!-- -->whatsoever, including but not limited to damages for lost profits, lost data, business interruption, personal injury, or pain and suffering arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p><p>In no event will Zeta AI&#x27;s total cumulative liability for all claims arising from or related to the Service (including any AI outputs or third-party service issues)<!-- --> <strong>exceed the amount you have paid to us for the Service in the last twelve (12) months</strong> <!-- -->(or, if you have not paid us, $0).</p><p>We specifically are<!-- --> <strong>not liable for any content generated by the AI</strong> <!-- -->or any actions you take in reliance on AI-generated content. You bear full responsibility for the decisions you make or actions you take using the Service.</p><p>These limitations apply regardless of the legal theory of liability (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">13. Indemnification</h1><p>You agree to<!-- --> <strong>indemnify, defend, and hold harmless</strong> Zeta AI, Inc. and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees and costs) that arise out of or relate to: (a) your use of the Service (including any content you generate or send using the Service), (b) your violation of these Terms or of any law or regulation, or (c) your infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property or privacy rights).</p><p>For example, if a third party brings a claim against Zeta AI because of something you emailed using Jace.ai (such as alleging that the content you sent was illegal or infringing), or because of some misuse of the Service by you, then you will be responsible for the costs and damages arising from that claim. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim). This indemnity obligation will survive the termination of your account and the use of the Service.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">14. Modifications to the Service and Terms</h1><p><strong>Service Changes:</strong> We are continually improving and evolving our Service. We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Service (or any part of it) at any time, with or without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Service is unavailable or altered at any time. We may impose new limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.</p><p><strong>Terms Changes:</strong> We may revise or update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through reasonable means, such as by posting the updated Terms on our website and updating the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top, and/or by sending a notice to the email address associated with your account. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically.<!-- --> <strong>By continuing to use the Service after updated Terms are posted, you accept and agree to the changes.</strong> <!-- -->If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you should stop using the Service and, if applicable, cancel your account.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h1><p>These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to the Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>State of Delaware, USA</strong>,<!-- --> <strong>without regard to its conflict of law principles</strong>. By using the Service, you agree that any disputes or claims arising from these Terms or your use of the Service shall be subject to the<!-- --> <strong>exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware</strong>. You waive any objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.</p><p><strong>International Use:</strong> We recognize that our Service can be accessed globally and that different laws may apply.

Notwithstanding the governing law stated above, you may have certain consumer protection rights under your local laws. These Terms are not intended to limit your statutory rights as a consumer that cannot be waived by contract.</p><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">16. Miscellaneous</h1><ul><li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (together with the Privacy Policy and any other guidelines or additional terms we reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Zeta AI regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to your use of the Service.</li><li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Zeta AI.</li><li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</li><li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any of your rights or obligations hereunder) without our prior written consent. We may freely assign these Terms, in whole or in part, for example to a subsidiary or in connection with a merger or acquisition, or sale of assets.
