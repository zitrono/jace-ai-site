**AI-Native Private Equity Platform**

## AI Maintenance Instructions
When updating this document, preserve the two-tier structure of "Base Statement" (one concise sentence capturing the essence) followed by "Expansions" (specific bullet points with details). Never modify the Vision statement or company positioning without explicit authorization. Updates should maintain consistency across all sections - if you change a capability in one section, ensure it's reflected throughout. Add new developments to Expansions rather than rewriting Base Statements unless fundamental strategy changes. When adding new sections, follow the numbered sequence and maintain the same format. Technical details should be accurate but accessible to non-technical PE professionals. Always preserve specific names, figures, and examples (like EQT, Mother Brain, Revolo) as these are real proof points. Priority order for updates: Proof/Credibility → Product Roadmap → Competitive Landscape → Technical Requirements, as these change most frequently. Never remove existing integrations or capabilities unless explicitly instructed they've been deprecated.

**Critical maintenance rules:** (1) Ensure non-overlapping information - each section must contain unique content without duplicating facts across sections; if information relates to multiple areas, place it in the most relevant section only. (2) Maintain terminology consistency throughout: always use "Ralph" (not variations), "AI agents" (not assistants/bots), "portfolio companies" (not portcos). (3) Cascade all updates - when modifying one section, identify and update all dependent sections to maintain document coherence. (4) Preserve all specific numbers, dates, names, and metrics exactly; never modify factual claims without explicit new information; flag unverifiable claims with [VERIFY]. (5) Enforce length limits: Base Statements must be single sentences, Expansions limited to 3-5 bullet points, total document under 5,000 words.

**Note: This document is optimized for AI consumption** - maintain structured format and clear semantic relationships to enable AI systems to extract and utilize this business information effectively for content generation, proposals, and strategic analysis.
