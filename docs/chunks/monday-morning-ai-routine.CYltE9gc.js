                DealCloud shows fourteen deals in various stages, but you're not sure which need attention
                today. Your phone buzzes with a text from an Operating Partner about a portfolio company
                issue you're just learning about. The Journal mentions one of your competitors closed
                a deal in your space. You didn't even know it was on the market. By 9 AM, you're in reactive
                mode, and the week already feels behind.

The choice isn't whether to embrace AI—82% of PE firms already use it. The choice is
              whether you'll be among the 5% who've mastered it at the partner level, or the 77%
              still figuring it out while competitors pull ahead.
