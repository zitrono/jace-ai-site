            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">
              The $50 Million Question Nobody's Asking
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Picture this: Your firm just invested $2 million in cutting-edge AI tools. Your
              partners are excited. The tech team is trained. Six months later, your associates are
              using it to... format pitch decks faster.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Sound familiar? You're not alone. While 82% of PE firms have adopted AI, only 5%
              report transformational results. The difference isn't in the technology—it's in the
              questions you're asking.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8">
              Most firms treat AI like a turbocharged Excel plugin, asking it to crunch numbers
              faster or summarize documents quicker. Meanwhile, firms like Blackstone are using AI
              to identify acquisition targets that traditional methods miss entirely, generating
              returns that outperform human analysts by 600%. The gap isn't about having better
              AI—it's about asking better questions.
            </p>

              Why Your AI Feels Like an Expensive Calculator
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Let's be honest about what's happening in most PE firms today. You're probably using
              AI to speed up existing processes rather than unlock new insights. It's the equivalent
              of buying a Ferrari and never leaving second gear.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-card rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
              <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Here's what we see every day:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300">
                <li>
                  Associates asking AI to "summarize this CIM" instead of "identify the three
                  biggest risks this management team isn't discussing."
                </li>
                <li>
                  Partners requesting "market comps for SaaS companies" rather than "which portfolio
                  companies should we exit in the next 18 months based on market cycle analysis."
                </li>
                <li>
                  Deal teams using AI for spell-check when they could be uncovering hidden synergies
                  worth millions.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8">
              The missed opportunities are staggering. One mid-market firm discovered their AI could
              have flagged a portfolio company's customer concentration risk six months before it
              materialized—if only they'd asked the right question.

                <strong class="text-white">Why it matters:</strong> Your best deals often share DNA that
                goes beyond sector or size. AI can pattern-match across millions of data points to find
                companies with similar unit economics, customer dynamics, or operational excellence that
                traditional screening misses.
