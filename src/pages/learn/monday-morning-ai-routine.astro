              <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4"><strong class="text-white">Morning One:</strong> You arrive at 7:30 AM to 247 unread emails from the weekend. Your assistant printed three portfolio reports—already outdated. DealCloud shows fourteen deals in various stages, but you're not sure which need attention today. Your phone buzzes with a text from an Operating Partner about a portfolio company issue you're just learning about. The Journal mentions one of your competitors closed a deal in your space. You didn't even know it was on the market. By 9 AM, you're in reactive mode, and the week already feels behind.</p>

Your AI assistant has already processed those 247 emails, flagging three that need immediate attention and summarizing the rest. Your portfolio dashboard shows real-time performance with AI-highlighted exceptions. That competitor's deal? You knew about it Friday because your AI caught the early signals. The portfolio issue? Identified and addressed proactively last week. By 9 AM, you've made three strategic decisions and your week is already won.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8">The choice isn't whether to embrace AI—82% of PE firms already use it. The choice is whether you'll be among the 5% who've mastered it at the partner level, or the 77% still figuring it out while competitors pull ahead.</p>
