## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### üî¥ **Design Tokens Violations** (Score: 73/100)
- **CSS Style Blocks**: 3 components contain forbidden `<style>` blocks
- **!important Usage**: Found in HeaderLayout.astro
- **Inline Styles**: Present in multiple components
- **Impact**: Breaks CLAUDE.md "NEVER DO" rules

### üî¥ **Global CSS Violation** (Score: 60/100)  
- **600+ lines of custom CSS** in Layout.astro violates "never mix global CSS with component styles"
- **Duplicate utilities** in design-tokens.css that duplicate Tailwind functionality
- **Impact**: Architectural violation, maintenance overhead

### üî¥ **Content Management Issues** (Score: 85/100)
- **Social proof statistics mismatch**: Companies.astro uses different numbers than approved content
- **Launch timeline inconsistency**: Q1 vs Q3 2025 across components
- **Impact**: Brand messaging inconsistency

### üî¥ **POM Compliance Gaps** (Score: 66/100)
- **Hero CTA**: Uses `btn-md` instead of required `btn-lg`
- **Mobile header height**: Not meeting 64px requirement
- **Touch targets**: Multiple buttons below 44px minimum
- **Impact**: Cannot achieve 99.9% POM compliance target

## Priority Action Plan

### **Immediate (This Week)**
1. **Remove all CSS style blocks** from TestimonialsNew, HeaderLayout, FAQ components
2. **Fix content inconsistencies** in Companies.astro social proof statistics
3. **Update Hero CTA** from btn-md to btn-lg for POM compliance
4. **Remove 600+ lines of custom CSS** from Layout.astro

### **High Priority (Next Week)**  
5. **Standardize mobile header height** to 64px requirement
6. **Fix touch target sizes** to minimum 44px
7. **Resolve launch timeline** inconsistency (Q1 vs Q3 2025)
8. **Remove Puppeteer dependency** (24MB) from production build

### **Medium Priority (Next Sprint)**
9. **Implement missing "Why Ralph" section** from Q78 content decision
10. **Add content validation** to build process

## Recommendations for CLAUDE.md Compliance

1. **Strengthen CSS Rules**: Add automated linting to prevent CSS style blocks
2. **Content Validation**: Implement build-time content consistency checks
3. **POM Integration**: Add POM compliance tests to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Design Token Enforcement**: Create ESLint rules for hardcoded color prevention

## Next Steps

The codebase is fundamentally sound with excellent architectural patterns. Focus on:
1. Eliminating CSS violations (highest impact)
2. Fixing POM compliance gaps (business critical)  
3. Content consistency improvements (brand integrity)
4. Performance optimization (already excellent, minor tweaks)

With these changes, the project will achieve **95+/100** compliance with CLAUDE.md guidelines and canonical best practices.
